## Meet Libby

This is Libby, my best friend's puppy. I got to know her for five years, and I'm her favorite person while I'm staying in my friend's house. She is the cutest little thing. She is always playful and her little body is very energetic.

## Interests

I love photographing, painting and printmaking. I was minoring [studio art](https://www.umass.edu/art/department-art) during bachelor degree. Studying arts help me to develop critical thinking and the ability to interpret the world around us.
